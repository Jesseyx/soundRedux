# SoundRedux

### This was forked from [sound-redux](https://github.com/andrewngu/sound-redux)

In an effort to learn es6 and [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux), this is SoundRedux, a simple [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com) client

See it in action at https://soundredux.io

Uses [normalizr](https://github.com/gaearon/normalizr)

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
3. visit `http://localhost:8080`

### Install local server

To see user authentication in action in your local environment, install and run the server.

The first way is to use [Go](https://golang.org/), please [see](https://github.com/andrewngu/sound-redux#install-local-server). But i wrote a simple script to do this.

1. `cd server`
2. `node authorizationServer.js`

Feedback, issues, etc. are more than welcome!
